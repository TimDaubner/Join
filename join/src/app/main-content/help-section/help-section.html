        Welcome to the help page for <span class="join">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project management
        tool. Here,
        we'll
        provide an overview of what <span class="join">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
        dedicated students
        as
        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard," is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the principles of
        kanban to
        help
        users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span>Join</span>:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Exploring the Board</strong><br>
            <span>When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents
                your project
                and
                contains
                four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Creating Contacts</strong><br>
            <span>In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                "Contacts"
                section,
                click on
                "New contact," and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks,
                and
                they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Adding Cards</strong><br>
            <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                Click the
                "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
                task
                name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Moving Cards</strong><br>
            <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                dropping the
                card from one list to another.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Deleting Cards</strong><br>
            <span>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                irreversible.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
